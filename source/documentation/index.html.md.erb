# Welcome to Cloud Operations

## Getting Started


## Documentation
By default we document products in their respective repositories (for example this [README](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-device-dns-dhcp-admin/blob/main/README.md) document)

Our ceremonies run 


- [Joining Cloud Operations Team](documentation/team-guide/joining-cloud-ops-team.html)


## Our Products
- [DNS](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-device-dns-dhcp-admin) - public name resolution for staff devices when local and remote. This service protects user traffic by forwarding queries to Protective DNS.
- [DHCP](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-device-dns-dhcp-admin) - automatic device configuration of MoJO DNS. This service helps devices when connected at sites reach the internet.
- [IMAP](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-monitoring) - The Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerting Platform aims to allow service owners and support teams to monitor the health of the MoJ infrastructure and identify failures as early as possible ahead of the end users noticing and reporting them.
- [Log Shipping](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-device-logging-infrastructure) - This is the Log Shipping infrastructure used by the Ministry of Justice to forward logs to the Operational Security Team.
- [PKI](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-certificate-services) - Public Key Infrastructure for devices and users. This repository can redeploy the EC2 instances which Entrust build their managed service on.
- [SMTP Relay](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-smtp-relay-server) - The Simple Mail Transort Protocol Relay service allows legacy MoJ applications and services to send unauthenticated email to staff devices and brings this system in house.

## Our alliance
As a team, we regularly discuss and decide on our alliance, and document these openly and publicly.

- We agree that itâ€™s ok to disagree and challenge opinions
- We agree that there are no stupid question
- We appreciate work takes time
- We are respectful of others time
- We code in the open
