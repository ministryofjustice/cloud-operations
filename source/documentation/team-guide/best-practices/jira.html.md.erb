# Jira

We use JIRA to manage our workload. 

The lifecycle of a ticket is as follows. A user realises a need in the system. This can be a Story, Bug or Task. Tickets in progress should be updated at the end of each day.

Once a ticket is in our backlog it will first go to [Backlog Refinement](../../documentation/general-information/our-ceremonies.html#backlog-refinement), where it will become 'Ready for Development' then prioritised in [Backlog Grooming](../../documentation/general-information/our-ceremonies.html#backlog-grooming). 

The ticket will then either be pulled into a Sprint during a [Sprint Planning](../../documentation/general-information/our-ceremonies.html#sprint-planning) session or it can remain indefinitely in 'Ready for Development' until the backlog is cleared out. 

If a ticket is Ready For Development, this does not necessarily mean the ticket will be ever be done. Tickets are pulled into Sprint based on their value and alignment to the current Roadmap. 

## Story 📚

## Bug 🐛

Anything detrimental to the system. Bugs affecting service are pulled into sprint and dealt with as a matter of priority.

## Task 📝

Something that can be completed by one person and is of limited complexity.  A task doesn't have to hold clear value for an end-user.
