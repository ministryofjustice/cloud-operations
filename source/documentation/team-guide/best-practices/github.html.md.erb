# Github

The cloud ops team follows a GitOps style workflow.  Any changes to the system should be made via a pull request against the appropriate repository.  

## All changes via Pull Request

All work undertaken by a member of the cloud ops team will take place in a branch. Branches are named after the corresponding ticket in Jira. Native integrations allow browsing straight to the branch from within Jira (if named correctly). An example of this is listed [here](../developing-on-a-branch.html).

## Commit Early, Commit Often

If you're asking yourself "should I commit now"? then the answer is probably yes!  Committing regularly helps with avoiding conflicts.  It is especially helpful when you're pulled away to another task and need a little reminder of where you were.

## Main Branch  

As GitHubs default practice our main branch is named 'main' and not 'master'. More information [here](https://github.com/github/renaming).

## Gitmoji ðŸ˜Ž

Yes, it made it to our best practices!  [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) is a great way to tag commits according to what they're doing. It's a great suppliment to your commit messages and can help identify key commits quickly.   

Most of all - [have fun ðŸ¥š](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) .
